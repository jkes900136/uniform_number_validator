# Uniform Number Validator in Rust

According to the Ministry of Finance announcement:

1. The Unified Number for Profit-Seeking Enterprises (hereinafter referred to as the Unified Number) is used by profit-seeking enterprises and withholding units. It is estimated that the vacant numbers will be used up in 2014.
2. In order to expand the unified number and make it compatible with the currently assigned unified number (the format of the old and new unified numbers is the same), public and private sectors are requested to cooperate in modifying the unified number verification program. The main modification is to "change the check logic from being divisible by '10' to being divisible by '5'". The relevant instructions are detailed in the attachment.
3. All public and private sectors in the country that use the unified numbering verification program should complete the modification of the unified numbering verification program before March 31, 2013, and also review and revise the relevant system documents.
4. It is expected that after April 2013, the unified numbering system of the new production system will be gradually released depending on the remaining status of the old numbers.
